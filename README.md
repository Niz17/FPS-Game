## Overview

The goal of this project is to establish an FPS environment where you shoot objects to collects coins (points) in a timed environment. It calculates your accuracy, the amount of coins generated (also coincides with the number of times you hit the bird), and the number of coins collected (your score)

## For the Unreal Engine Files
Go to the link provided in the backup_upload.md file and go to the Unreal Engine files. There, you should find different folders and files for the program. The Content folder contains the *objects* and *textures." It also contains the blueprints (code) for the program. However, in order to access it, you might need to download Unreal Engine through the Epic Games Launcher. 

To make it easier to look into this, we also have a folder filled with screenshots of all the blueprints used in the Code Details Image folder. In order to understand what the code is doing, you can also look into the Code Documentation file, which had all the images from the file with comments attached to it. 

If you would want to look into the flowchart (more of a high level planning), it's also in the Documentation > flowchat.pdf file. 

And if you'd want to look into the .fbx, .blend, or the textures we used for the objects and images, it's in the ".blend_and_textures" folder. To understand what our goal was for the project, navigate to the folder with Documentation > Documentation_File.pdf. It contains detailed information about the objects and the environment setup.

## For the Runnable Game 
Go to link provided in the backup_upload.md file and go to the "Runnable Game" folder. There, you should find the .exe file for the game, which you can double click. And they game will start. You can now play as long as you want. However, you may find some trouble in quitting the game, so you might need to click the Windows button (if in Windows) to close the game.
